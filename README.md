## 🌟 AI-Powered Waste Identification
Simply upload or capture an image, and our AI model instantly classifies the waste into categories such as:

♻️ **Recyclable:** Plastic, paper, metal, glass  
🌿 **Organic:** Food scraps, garden waste  
⚡ **E-Waste:** Batteries, electronics, chargers  
☣️ **Hazardous:** Chemicals, medical waste, biohazards  

The system provides **real-time analysis** with high accuracy, helping users make informed disposal decisions.

## ♻️ Smart Disposal Recommendations
Our AI not only identifies waste but also guides you on where and how to dispose of it responsibly:

✅ **Organic Waste** → Composting or fertilizer production  
✅ **Plastic & Paper** → Recycling plants or drop-off centers  
✅ **E-Waste** → Certified disposal units or refurbishing programs  
✅ **Hazardous Waste** → Safe disposal at specialized facilities  

💡 **Encouraging a Circular Economy:** Instead of sending waste to landfills, we connect users with industries that can repurpose materials, promoting sustainability and resource efficiency.
